If you have these problems, read on.

Virtual Closet is a web application where users can upload their entire wardrobe digitally and keep them organized by category, color, pattern and occasion.
The main purpose of this application is to allow users to keep track of what they already have and help them check against their wardrobe on-the-go when they go shopping. 
Users can also plan their outfits for the week with the build in weather plug-in.
